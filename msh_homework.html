<p>Our solar system consists of the sun and everything that orbits that sun, like the eight (once nine) planets we all know from elementary school. But the main planets,  as diverse and fascinating as they are, are just the beginning. 
Earth's neighbors in space include comets, asteroids, dwarf planets, mysterious moons and a host of strange phenomena that are so out-of-this-world they elude explanation.</p>

<h3> About the Solar System</h3>
	<li>The Solar System is all the planets and other things in space that orbit (go around) our sun.</li>
	<li>The planets are in the order Mecury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune followed by the award planet Pluto.</li>
	<li>Earth is a big place but within the solar system it is quite small.</li>
	<li>If you combined the mass of everything in the solar system, the sun would account for more than 99 percent of that mass.</li><l>

    <h3> Some fun facts that you may not know</h3>

                    <h3>
                   THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS REALLY, REALLY BIG </h3>
           <p> NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft was launched in 1977. More than three decades later, in 2012, it became the first human-made object to enter interstellar space by crossing the heliopause, or the edge of the heliosphere. That's the boundary beyond which most of the sun's ejected particles and magnetic fields dissipate.

                EVEN JUST OUR NEIGHBORHOOD IS REALLY, REALLY BIG
            </h3>
            <p>
                Depending on how carefully you do the calculations and how you arrange them, all of the planets in the solar system could fit in between Earth and its moon

                URANUS SPINS SIDEWAYS 
            </h3>
            <p>
                Uranus usually appears in classroom solar system models as a featureless blue ball, but this gas giant of the outer solar system is pretty weird on closer inspection. First, the planet rotates on its side, appearing to roll around the sun like a ball, according to NASA's Uranus guide(opens in new tab). The most likely explanation for the planet's unusual orientation (about 90 degrees sideways compared to the other planets) is that it underwent some sort of titanic collision in the ancient past.
